		"description": "##### This local documentation is a copy of [https://ambientweather.docs.apiary.io/#]() please refer to that link for the most up-to-date information.\n\nI have omitted the connector library list. You can generate code for just about any language right from Postman.\n\n## Authentication\n\nTwo API Keys are required for all REST API requests:\n\n- `applicationKey` - identifies the developer / application. To create an application key please login to your AmbientWeather.net account page ([https://ambientweather.net/account]())\n- `apiKey` - grants access to past/present data for a given  \n    user's devices. A typical consumer-facing application will initially  \n    ask the user to create an `apiKey` on their AmbientWeather.net account page ([https://ambientweather.net/account]())  \n    and paste it into the app. Developers for personal or in-house apps  \n    will also need to create an apiKey on their own account page.\n    \n\n## Rate Limiting\n\nAPI requests are capped at 1 request/second for each user's apiKey  \nand 3 requests/second per applicationKey. When this limit is exceeded,  \nthe API will return a 429 response code. Please be kind to our servers  \n:)## Data Timing\n\nThe devices returned from the `/devices` endpoint contain a `lastData`  \nparameter that contains the most up-to-date data we have for the  \ndevice. Most devices update every minute, some update less frequently.  \nThe timestamps are rounded to the nearest minute.\n\nQueries for past data using the `/devices/:macAddress`  \nendpoint are returned in 5 minute or 30 minute increments. There can be  \nup to a 10 minute delay before the most recent data becomes available.  \nIf you need up-to-the-minute data please use the `/devices` endpoint or _forthcoming_ realtime API.\n\n## HTTP Response Codes\n\n(non-comprehensive list - just the ones I've seen)\n\n- 200: Success - You should get data back\n- 429: Rate Limit Exceeded\n- 401: Invalid API Key\n    ## Other Resources\n\n- API Wiki - [https://github.com/ambient-weather/api-docs/wiki]()\n- [Device]() Data Specifications: [https://github.com/ambient-weather/api-docs/wiki/Device-Data-Specs]()",
